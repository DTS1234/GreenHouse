 Application that regulates the temperature and humidity in a greenhouse - programming excersice

Each temperature sensor is reading temperature while each humidity sensor is reading humidity of the greenhouse periodically,
it feeds it back to the application giving it temperature or humidity awareness.

Then, the application can order open or close actions upon doors to mitigate hot/cold. 
It acts on the irrigation system as well, to mitigate high/low humidity in order to maintain adequate levels.

Besides, it checks the quality of the electronic devices in the greenhouse (sensors and automatic doors) in
order to monitor correct operation.
